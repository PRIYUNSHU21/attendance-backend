# 📋 FRONTEND TEAM: API ENDPOINT STATUS UPDATE

## 🎯 CURRENT SITUATION

The **NEW** `/admin/students` endpoint has been **CREATED** but is **NOT YET DEPLOYED** to production.

## ✅ WORKING ENDPOINTS (Production Ready)

### 1. Teacher Authentication ✅
```
POST https://attendance-backend-go8h.onrender.com/auth/login
Body: {"email": "beta@gmail.com", "password": "Beta123#"}
Response: {
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "user_id": "...",
      "name": "BETA", 
      "role": "teacher",
      "org_id": "fc063474-991b-4747-ab88-43058fd50f4c"
    },
    "jwt_token": "eyJ..."
  }
}
```

### 2. Health Check ✅
```
GET https://attendance-backend-go8h.onrender.com/health
Response: {"success": true, "data": {"status": "healthy"}}
```

## ⚠️ PROBLEMATIC ENDPOINTS

### 1. Generic User Endpoint (Returns 500 Error)
```
❌ GET /admin/users
Status: 500 Internal Server Error
Issue: Server-side database query problems
```

### 2. New Students Endpoint (Not Deployed)
```
❌ GET /admin/students  
Status: 404 Not Found
Issue: Code exists locally but not deployed to production
```

## 🔧 WHAT'S NEEDED FOR DEPLOYMENT

To make the new `/admin/students` endpoint available in production:

1. **Push Code to Repository** - The new endpoint code needs to be committed and pushed
2. **Trigger Render Deployment** - Render needs to rebuild and deploy the updated code
3. **Verify Database Schema** - Ensure production database supports the queries

## 💡 TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS FOR FRONTEND

### Option A: Wait for Deployment
- Best option for production use
- Will have the dedicated students endpoint with proper pagination

### Option B: Use Alternative Approach
Since teacher authentication works, you could potentially:
1. Create a simple user listing endpoint that filters by organization
2. Use direct database queries through a different route

## 📝 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### For Backend Team:
1. **URGENT**: Deploy the new `/admin/students` endpoint to production
2. Debug why `/admin/users` returns 500 errors
3. Test student credentials (gamma@gmail.com authentication is failing)

### For Frontend Team:
1. **Use working teacher authentication** for now
2. **Wait for deployment notification** before implementing student list features
3. **Prepare to handle pagination** in the student list (the new endpoint includes pagination)

## 🚀 NEW ENDPOINT SPECS (Once Deployed)

```javascript
// Get students in teacher's organization
GET /admin/students
Headers: {
  "Authorization": "Bearer <teacher_jwt_token>",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

  "data": [
    {
      "user_id": "student-uuid",
      "name": "Student Name",

      "is_active": true,
      "role": "student"
    }
